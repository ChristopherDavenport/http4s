## http4s Contrib

This is a place for tools and utils relating to http4s that are too small to be their own project yet important enough to share with the world.

Packaged contributed here will stay in the repo so long as they are maintained. If you find that one day your favorite contrib tool has faded into the digital ether, it is likely due to a lack of maintenance. Feel free to pick up the mantle and get it back in!

### How to contribute?
First things first, all contributions must be donated under the Apache 2 licensed by their origional authors. Next, send a pull request! Contributions should integrate their work into the repository as its own project with its own README.md and include some level of testing. Authors should be prepared to maintain their contribution or it may be dropped from the repo.
